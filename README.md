# i3config
i3onfig that I have gotten to work for me and a screen extension toggler


both dot directories are supposed to go in the home directory, make sure the script in .toggles is executable:

`
chmod +x .toggles/screens_extend_toggle.sh
`

if all goes well, `Win+p` should switch between hdmi-01 + internal screen and internal screen only mode
